      - Thesis: Phosphorus recovery from sewage sludge through integrated thermochemical treatment and sequential wet extraction.
      - Independently designed, planned, and executed pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization experiments; processed samples; conducted a detailed analysis of phosphorus in environmental samples. Achieved 50 % higher phosphorus extraction efficiency compared to control scenario, without simultaneous extraction of toxic heavy metals via a novel process.
